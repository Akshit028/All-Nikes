## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ About All Nike's

All-Nike's is my first fully functional project after learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript  

I build these website to make my basic concepts clear using different functionalities like first thing the UI looks clean although my main focus was not on css but JS functionalities 

First of all I made Home page of All-Nike's which contains of Navbar, Mid Section and Footer, Navbar contains nav links which redirects to different html pages, Mid Section contains Banner Image, Product Cards, Carousel, Buttons, etc. Footer also contains navlinks. 

To navigate I have made seperate page for each and every product I have made different pages for Mens, Womens, Sale, Sports, etc which further contains products and clicking on product redirects to full product description.

User can add product to card via selecting size and can checkout on that page itself.

After placing order user is redirected to a page where user gets tracking ID and can track the order on tracking page.

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking.
